I wrote this code for my university project. I implemented a simple class for triangles.
Nobody has never done this before and nobody will do so becuase it is pretty much useless.
Regardless, this project helped me underestand classes and OOP and also taught me how to create user-defined types.
Thank you, Aryan.
